# NexGuard Demo Script (5-7 Minutes)

## 0:00 - Intro
- **Visual**: Show NexGuard Landing Page.
- **Audio**: "Hi, I'm [Name] from Team NexGuard. We're building the first real-time security platform for Cardano meme coins. With the explosion of meme tokens, scams are rampant. NexGuard solves this with AI-driven risk analysis and community verification."

## 0:30 - Connect Wallet
- **Visual**: Click "Launch App". Click "Connect Wallet". Select Eternl (or mock connection).
- **Audio**: "Let's enter the app. I'll connect my Cardano wallet to get started. We support all major wallets via the CIP-30 standard."

## 1:00 - Explore Tokens
- **Visual**: Navigate to "Explorer". Scroll through the list of tokens. Hover over Trust Scores.
- **Audio**: "Here's the live explorer. You can see real-time trust scores for every token. These aren't just random numbers—they're calculated from on-chain data, liquidity depth, and community reports."

## 2:00 - AI Risk Analysis (The "Wow" Moment)
- **Visual**: Click on a specific token (e.g., "SNEK" or a test token). Click the "Run Deep Risk Analysis" button.
- **Audio**: "But we go deeper. This is Masumi Copilot, our AI risk agent. I'll ask it to analyze this token."
- **Visual**: Wait for the loading animation. Show the result: Explanation, Suggested Delta, and Decision Hash.
- **Audio**: "The agent analyzes the token's policy, holder distribution, and recent reports. It gives us a plain-English explanation and a suggested score adjustment. Crucially, it generates a unique 'Decision Hash'."

## 3:00 - Publish to Chain
- **Visual**: Click "Publish to Chain". Show the status changing to "Signing" -> "Confirmed". Point to the "On-Chain Verified" badge.
- **Audio**: "Transparency is key. We don't just keep this analysis on a server. I can publish this risk assessment directly to the Cardano blockchain using our Aiken smart contract. Now, this risk score is immutable and verifiable by anyone."

## 4:00 - Whistleblower Report
- **Visual**: Click the "Report" icon (flag). Type a reason (e.g., "Rug pull detected"). Submit.
- **Audio**: "Community vigilance is our second layer of defense. Users can submit whistleblower reports. In the production version, these are verified using ZK proofs to protect the reporter's identity while ensuring the claim is valid."

## 5:00 - Audit Trail
- **Visual**: Navigate to the "Audits" tab. Show the list of events (Mint, Trade, Publish, Report).
- **Audio**: "Everything is tracked. The Audit Trail shows a complete history of the token, including the risk analysis we just published and the community report."

## 6:00 - Architecture & Conclusion
- **Visual**: Briefly show the architecture diagram (if available) or just the team slide.
- **Audio**: "NexGuard combines the power of AI agents with the security of Cardano smart contracts to create a safer DeFi ecosystem. Thank you for watching."
